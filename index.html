                    I was born in Qingdao, a beautiful coastal city in the north.
                    I graduated from macau university of science and technology with a bachelor's degree in computer science.
                    I am now studying electronic and information engineering at the Hong Kong polytechnic university.
                    The reason why I chose to major in electronic and information engineering instead of information technology is that in the next year, I hope to get in touch with some fields that I didn't often contact during the four years of undergraduate study, such as Internet of things and wireless communication.
                    Because of huawei and its 5G, the topic of communication is now undoubtedly the hottest technology topic in the Chinese mainland.
                    Therefore, I also had an idea to learn something about communication.

                    I also have some unique experiences in academic research and work.
                    First, I had an internship.
                    During this period, I was engaged in data visualization and data analysis in a quantitative trading company in shenzhen.
                    Secondly, during my undergraduate study and after graduation, I cooperated with my tutor to conduct some academic research.
                    First, my tutor Alex Leung and I worked with the new welfare bus company in macau and ASTRI in Hong Kong to design and customize a system based on deep learning and image tracking processing to assist bus companies in evaluating bus drivers and identifying their bad habits during driving.
                    After graduation, I did not directly start my postgraduate study, but chose to continue to cooperate with my tutor to carry out some academic research.
                    At the end of 2018, I went to the smart city research institute of Shanghai university for study and exchange.
                    It was only a few months, but it was a very rewarding experience.
                    Now in my spare time, I also continue to finish an academic paper.
                    The topic of this paper is the analysis of social networks within companies.
